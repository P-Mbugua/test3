            They then met guitarist Polycarp Otieno, who attended Strathmore School, at Nairobis Alliance française, where they would frequent, and decided to form Sauti (Swahili for “sound”) and immediately wrote their first song, Mafunzo ya Dunia (Literally: lessons of the world), which would later feature in their debut studio album Mwanzo.
